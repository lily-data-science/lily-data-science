# Hi. My name is Yunwei (nickname: Lily). Currently, I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist.

### I will graduate in May 2022 with a Master in Statistics/ Data Science Concentration at California State University East Bay.  

### The following are some highlight for my skills:

1. Machine Learning (i.e. random forest) and Neural Network coding and set up for a supervised or unsupervised predictive model 
2. Computer Vision coding on android developer for creating a mobile app in image detection and recognition using deep learning method, such as Efficient net.
3. Visualization Tool: Tableau, Shiny R app, Power BI, Visio, Spotfire, Visio
4. Data Analysis Tool: Python, R programming, SAS, SQL, SIMCA 
5. Automation Tool: Power Automate 
6. Statistics Knowledge in Data Distribution (i.e. Gamma Distribution, Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution) and calculate Maximum Likelihood or Method of Moment. Creating a Multivariate Analysis using linear, logistic, or non parametric regression methods. Baysian Statistics. Random Effect. Nesting. Confidence Interval. Hypothesis testing. 

### Highlighted Projects:

1. Kaggle Project 
2. Sentiment Prediction
3. Shiny Apps
4. Neural Network Computer Vision Mobile App
5. Advanced Computational Statistical Methods (Parametric and Nonparametric)
6. Time Series Plot 
7. Geographical Graphs (both Interactive and non-interactive)
8. Word Cloud and Topic ranking by Frequency 

## 1. Kaggle Project Machine Learning

### Lending Club Data (Training: 308455 observations Testing: 102818 observations accuracy: 99.83466% Random Forest Method) 

## 2. Sentiment Review on Movie Analysis (Natural Language Processing)

**Accuracy is 95.03935% on 12500 movie reviews (Test case) Training Data Set: 25000 movie reviews**
**DataSource: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/**
**Build a sentiment analysis model using multiple linear regression and naive bay with different vectorization methods, such as bigram, normalization, and feature hashing. Compare each method's accuracy and come up with the best model.**

## 3. Shiny App (eyeUSA)

These are interactive app that creates visualization and reports on rate of vision problems, such as diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma, by gender or age.
EyeUSA app has a predictive model to predict the rate of US population of having the eye problem based on National Eye Institute funded data.
