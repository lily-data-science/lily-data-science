Hi. My name is Yunwei Chang (Lily). 

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Statistics with Data Science concentration from California State University, East Bay at Hayward,CA. 

Currently I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist.

I have a solid background in data analysis and statistical modeling. With a deep understanding in statistical theories, I have also completed several data analysis and data science projects applying statistical methods in R and Python with large datasets. These projects involve several parts of data analysis such as deep learning method, large data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, regression (machine learning), data mining, data visualization and data manipulation with SQL.

Moreover, I have several projects on computer vision research and on mobile application. The mobile application involves an interface, image detection and recognition method, and deep learning method output.
