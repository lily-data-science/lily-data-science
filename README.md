# Hi. My name is Yunwei (nickname: Lily). Currently, I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist.

### I will graduate in May 2022 with a Master in Statistics/ Data Science Concentration at California State University East Bay (current GPA 3.96).  

### The following are some highlight for my skills:

1. Machine Learning (i.e. random forest) and Neural Network coding and set up for a supervised or unsupervised predictive model 
2. Computer Vision coding on android developer for creating a mobile app in image detection and recognition using deep learning method, such as Efficient net.
3. Visualization Tool: Tableau, Shiny R app, Power BI, Visio, Spotfire, Visio
4. Data Analysis Tool: Python, R programming, SAS, SQL, SIMCA 
5. Automation Tool: Power Automate 
6. Statistics Knowledge in Data Distribution (i.e. Gamma Distribution, Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution) and calculate Maximum Likelihood or Method of Moment. Creating a Multivariate Analysis using linear, logistic, or non parametric regression methods. Baysian Statistics. Random Effect. Nesting. Confidence Interval. Hypothesis testing. 

### Projects:
1. Neural Network Computer Vision Mobile App
2. Kaggle Project 
3. Sentiment Prediction
4. Shiny App
5. Advanced Computational Statistical Methods (Parametric and Nonparametric)
6. Time Series Plot 
7. Geographical Graphs (both Interactive and non-interactive)
8. Word Cloud and Topic ranking by Frequency 

## 1. Neural Network Computer VIsion Mobile App 

Group Project Credit Abinaya, Krina, and Yunwei. Training Data: Mohammad Mahoor PHD. ![Emotion Recognition Mobile App](https://github.com/lily-data-science/Emotion-Recognition/blob/master/facial_emotion_demo.png)

## 2a. Kaggle Project Machine Learning

### Titanic Model Selection Project (Null, KNN, C50, random forest, multiple linear regression, and Naive Bayes)

In this Kaggle project, models used include: Null, KNN, C50, random forest, multiple linear regression, and Naive Bayes. In the end, we pick random forest as the best model with the highest accuracy, 85.96% accuracy.

Training data set: 713 observations with survivor information from Titanic
Testing data set: 178 without survivor information from Titanic on Kaggle.


### Boxplots show gender is the most important factor determining if a person survive from Titanic incidence

## 2b. Kaggle Project Machine Learning

### Lending Club Data (Training: 308455 observations Testing: 102818 observations accuracy: 99.83466% Random Forest Method) 

## 3. Sentiment Review on Movie Analysis (Natural Language Processing)

**Accuracy is 95.03935% on 12500 movie reviews (Test case) Training Data Set: 25000 movie reviews**
**DataSource: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/**
**Build a sentiment analysis model using multiple linear regression and naive bay with different vectorization methods, such as bigram, normalization, and feature hashing. Compare each method's accuracy and come up with the best model.**
